"I have scanned a full list of the cards for you to see. Sorry to those of you on your phones, the text is SUPER small. But here- http://imgur.com/a/qEPMl   Strangely, there is a 330 card list (many sets were 350 cards- 20 basics and 330 cards- back then) and a 429 card list. Perhaps a way to break it into a two set block? But this is the most final and conclusive list I have. I would love to hear your thoughts on it, and at some point I will share scans of the playtesting cards. There was four rounds of playtesting, and I have the master lists of the first three rounds, as well as most cards from round four. In due time. And did you miss last week's post? Here is a video: http://youtu.be/eaOh-EqNYvE Enjoy!"
